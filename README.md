# coral-embryo-leachate
A single stressor experiment testing the embryonic development of Montipora capitata corals when exposed to PVC leachate.

sample_id naming convention: In summary, there are 10 full replicates fixed for microscopy and 15 full replicates for omics across 4 leachate levels: control, low, middle, high, & 3 levels of embryonic development: 4hpf, 9hpf, 14hpf. 

  (1-15): The preceding number for the sample_id is the replicate according to genetic cross.
  (C,L,M,H): The four levels of leachate exposure. C stands for control, 1.2um filtered seawater. L stands for 'low', 0.01mg/L PVC Leachate. M stands for 'mid', 0.1mg/L PVC Leachate. H stands for 'high', 1mg/L PVC Leacate. All leachate was prepared according to the [leachate preparaton & dilution protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/projects/anemone/leachate-protocol/leachate-protocol.html)
  (4,9,14): The three levels of embryonic development assessed: 4 stands for 4 hours post fertilization, where eggs should have fertilized and reaached initial cleavage. 9 stands for 9 hours post fertilization, where embryos should be developed to the prawn chip phase. 14 stands for 14 hours post fertilization, when embryos should be reaching early gastrulation. 
  (Z, F): The two 'destinies' for the samples... either "Z", which stands for fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for later microscopy, or "F" which stands for frozen at -800C in DNA/RNA Shield for later RNA extraction.
