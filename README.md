# coral-embryo-leachate
This project is a single stressor experiment exploring the early embryonic development of *Montipora capitata* corals when exposed to PVC leachate. In this project we look at how PVC leachate affects both physical cells and gene expression of coral embryos during development from unfertilized egg to the early gastrulation phases.

An ecotoxicological assay of *Montipora capitata* coral embryo development and gene expression under increasing PVC leachate exposures](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/projects/coral-leachate-heat.html) contains all of the open notebook posts related to this project. 

The [Bioinformatic Pipeline Roadmap](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/projects/coral-embryo-leachate/bioinformatics-pipeline/pipeline-overview.html) walks through the coding workflow used to analyze RNA-seq data.
